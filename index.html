    <p>If you're here that likely means a project linked you here.
    <p>Thanks so much for being interested in that project!
    <p>Open Source is rewarding, but occasionally exhausting.
    <p>The linking project's code is provided as-is, and not actively maintained.
    <p>The developer(s) of that project invite you peruse their code, and even use it in your next project, provided you follow the included licensing!
    <p>No guarantee of support for the code is provided, and there is no guarantee that pull requests will be merged.
    <p>It's open source, so forking is permitted- just be sure to give credit where it's due!
